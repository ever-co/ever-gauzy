### Staging

-   Gauzy Platform Staging builds (using CI/CD, from the `stage` branch) are available at <https://stage.gauzy.co>
-   We are using the Staging environment to test releases before they are deployed to the production environment
-   Our pre-releases of desktop/server apps are built from this environment and can be configured manually (in settings) to connect to Stage API: <https://apistage.gauzy.co>

### Server & Desktop Apps

We have Gauzy Server and two Desktop Apps (for Windows/Mac/Linux):

-   Ever¬Æ Gauzy‚Ñ¢ Server - includes Gauzy API, SQLite DB (or connects to external PostgreSQL) and serves Guazy frontend. It allows to quickly run Gauzy Server for multiple clients (browser-based or Desktop-based). It's a recommended option if you want to setup the Ever Gauzy Platform in small to medium organizations.

-   Ever¬Æ Gauzy‚Ñ¢ Desktop App - includes Gauzy frontend (UI), Gauzy API, SQLite DB, etc., all-in-one! It allows to quickly run the whole Gauzy solution locally, both UI and Timer (for time tracking, optionally of course). In addition, it allows you to connect to the external database (e.g. PostgreSQL) or external API (if you have Gauzy Server with API / DB installed on a different computer or if you want to connect to our live API). It's a recommended option if you want to try Gauzy quickly / for personal use or if you want to connect to Gauzy Server in the "client-server" configuration (and use Desktop App instead of web browser).

-   Ever¬Æ Gauzy‚Ñ¢ Desktop Timer App - allows running Time and Activity Tracking for employees/contractors with screenshots and activity monitoring. It is recommended to setup by organization employees as long as they are not interested in other Gauzy Platform features (e.g. accounting) and only need to track work time.

More information about our Server & Desktop Apps:

-   Download for your OS from the official [Downloads](https://web.gauzy.co/downloads) page or see the section "Download" above for other links to our releases pages.
-   Setup Gauzy Server with default choices in Setup Wizard and run it.
-   You can also setup Gauzy Desktop App (can run independently or connect to Gauzy Server) or Gauzy Desktop Timer App (should be connected to Gauzy Server)
-   You can login with `admin@ever.co` and password `admin` to check Admin functionality if you installed Gauzy Server or Gauzy Desktop App. Note: such an Admin user is not an employee, so you will not be able to track time.
-   You can login with `employee@ever.co` and password `123456` to check Employee-related functionality in Gauzy UI or to run Desktop Timer from an "Employee" perspective (such a user is an Employee and can track time).
-   If you install Gauzy Server, it is possible to connect to it using a browser (by default on <http://localhost:4200>) or using Gauzy Desktop Apps (make sure to configure Desktop apps to connect to Gauzy API on <http://127.0.0.1:3000/api> because it's where Gauzy Server API runs by default).
-   You can read more information about our Desktop Apps on the [Desktop Apps Wiki Page](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Gauzy-Desktop-Apps) and our Server at the [Server Wiki Page](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Gauzy-Server).

## üß± Technology Stack and Requirements

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) language

#### See also README.md and CREDITS.md files in relevant folders for lists of libraries and software included in the Platform, information about licenses, and other details

## üìÑ Documentation

Please refer to our official [Platform Documentation](https://docs.gauzy.co) and our [Wiki](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki) (WIP).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### With Docker Compose

-   Clone repo.
-   Make sure you have Docker Compose [installed locally](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
-   Run `docker-compose up`, if you want to run the platform in production configuration using our prebuild Docker images. Check `.env.compose` file for different settings (optionally), e.g. DB type. _(Note: Docker Compose will use latest images pre-build automatically from head of `master` branch using GitHub CI/CD.)_
-   Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up`, if you want to run the platform in basic configuration (e.g. for Demo / explore functionality / quick run) using our prebuild Docker images. Check `.env.demo.compose` file for different settings (optionally), e.g. DB type. _(Note: Docker Compose will use latest images pre-build automatically from head of `master` branch using GitHub CI/CD.)_
-   Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up`, if you want to build everything (code and Docker images) locally. Check `.env.compose` file for different settings (optionally), e.g. DB type. _(Note: this is extremely long process because it builds whole platform locally. Other options above are much faster!)_
-   :coffee: time... It might take some time for our API to seed fake data in the DB during the first Docker Compose run, even if you used prebuild Docker images.
-   Open <http://localhost:4200> in your browser.
-   Login with email `admin@ever.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
-   Login with email `employee@ever.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
-   Enjoy!

Together with Gauzy, Docker Compose will run the following:

-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - Primary Database.
-   [Pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb) - Cross-platform client for PostgreSQL DBs, available on <http://localhost:8081>.
-   [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) - Search Engine.
-   [Dejavu](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu) - Web UI for ElasticSearch, available on <http://localhost:1358>.
-   [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) - Multi-Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è Object Storage (AWS S3 compatible).
-   [Jitsu](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) - Jitsu is an open-source Segment alternative. Fully scriptable data ingestion engine for modern data teams.
-   [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) - In-memory data store/caching (also used by Jitsu)
-   [Cube](https://github.com/cube-js/cube) - "Semantic Layer" used for Reports, Dashboards, Analytics, and other BI-related features, with UI available on <http://localhost:4000>.

### Manually

#### Required

-   Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS version or later, e.g. 18.x.
-   Install [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) (if you don't have it) with `npm i -g yarn`.
-   Install NPM packages and bootstrap solution using the command `yarn bootstrap`.
-   If you will need to make code changes (and push to Git repo), please run `yarn prepare:husky`.
-   Adjust settings in the [`.env.local`](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/blob/develop/.env.local) which is used in local runs.
-   Alternatively, you can copy [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/blob/develop/.env.sample) to `.env` and change default settings there, e.g. database type, name, user, password, etc.
-   Run both API and UI with a single command: `yarn start`.
-   Open Gauzy UI on <http://localhost:4200> in your browser (API runs on <http://localhost:3000/api>).
-   Login with email `admin@ever.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
-   Login with email `employee@ever.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
-   Enjoy!

Notes:

-   during the first API start, DB will be automatically seeded with a minimum set of initial data if no users are found.
-   you can run seed any moment manually (e.g. if you changed entities schemas) with the `yarn seed` command to re-initialize DB (warning: unsafe for production!).
-   it is possible to run generation of extremely large amounts of fake data for demo purposes/testing with `yarn seed:all` (warning: takes ~10 min to complete)

#### Optional / Recommended for Production

-   Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) version 14 or later. Note: other DB can be configured manually in TypeORM. The default DB is set to SQLite (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
-   Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Notes: the platform will work without Redis using an in-memory caching strategy instead of a distributed one (recommended for testing/demo purposes only). Please note however that Redis is required for Jitsu.
-   Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). Note: the platform will work without ElasticSearch using DB build-in search capabilities (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
-   Optionally install and run [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) or [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). Note: the platform will work without MinIO / LocalStack or other S3-compatible storage using local filesystem-based storage (recommended for testing/demo purposes only). For production, we recommend using Wasabi or AWS S3 storage or another S3-compatible cloud storage.
-   Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [Jitsu](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu). Note: the platform will work without Jitsu, however, data ingestion will be disabled for additional analyses / real-time pipelines.
-   Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [Cube](https://github.com/cube-js/cube). Note: the platform will work without Cube, however some advanced (dynamic) reporting and data processing capabilities will be disabled.

### Production

-   See [Setup Gauzy for Client Server](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Setup-Gauzy-for-Client-Server) for more information about production setup on your servers.
-   We recommend deploying to Kubernetes (k8s), either manually (see below) or with our [Ever Helm Charts](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-charts).
-   For simple deployment scenarios (e.g. for yourself or your small organization), check our [Kubernetes configurations](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/tree/develop/.deploy/k8s), which we are using to deploy Gauzy into [DigitalOcean k8s cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes).
-   In addition, check [Gauzy Pulumi](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy-pulumi) project (WIP), it makes complex Clouds deployments possible with a single command (`pulumi up`). Note: it currently supports AWS EKS (Kubernetes) for development and production with Application Load Balancers and AWS RDS Serverless PostgreSQL DB deployments. We also implemented deployments to ECS EC2 and Fargate Clusters in the same Pulumi project.
