### Production (SaaS, WIP)

### Dev Builds

- Gauzy Platform Dev builds (using CI/CD, from the `develop` branch) will be available later at <https://app.gauzy.dev>

### Server & Desktop Apps

We have Gauzy Server and two Desktop Apps (for Windows/Mac/Linux): 

- Ever® Gauzy™ Server - includes Gauzy API, SQLite DB (or connects to external PostgreSQL) and serves Guazy frontend. It allows to quickly run Gauzy Server for multiple clients (browser based or Desktop based). It's recommended option if you want to setup Ever Gauzy Platform in the small to medium organizations.

- Ever® Gauzy™ Desktop App - includes Gauzy frontend (UI), Gauzy API, SQLite DB, etc., all-in-one! It allows to quickly run the whole Gauzy solution locally, both UI and Timer (for time tracking, optionally of course). In addition, it allows to connect to the external database (e.g. PostgreSQL) or external API (if you have Gauzy Server with API / DB installed on different computer or if you want to connect to our live API). It's recommended option if you want to try Gauzy quickly / for personal use or if you want to connect to Gauzy Server in the "client-server" configuration (and use Desktop App instead of web browser).

- Ever® Gauzy™ Desktop Timer App - allows to run Time & Activity Tracking for employees (agent) with screenshots and activity monitoring. Recommended to setup by organization employees as long as they are not interested in other Gauzy Platform features (e.g. accounting) and only need to track work time.

More information about our Server & Desktop Apps:

- Download for your OS from the official [Downloads](https://web.gauzy.co/downloads) page or see section "Download" above for other links to our releases pages.
- Setup Gauzy Server with default choices in Setup Wizard and run it.
- You can also setup Gauzy Desktop App (can run independently or connect to Gauzy Server) or Gauzy Desktop Timer App (should be connected to Gauzy Server)
- You can login with `admin@ever.co` and password `admin` to check Admin functionality if you installed Gauzy Server or Gauzy Desktop App. Note: such Admin user is not an employee, so you will not be able to track time.
- You can login with `employee@ever.co` and password `123456` to check Employee related functionality in Gauzy UI or to run Desktop Timer from "Employee" perspective (such user is an Employee and can track time).
- If you install Gauzy Server, it is possible to connect to it using browser (by default on <http://localhost:8084>) or using Gauzy Desktop Apps (make sure to configure Desktop apps to connect to Gauzy API on <http://127.0.0.1:5620/api> because it's where Gauzy Server API runs by default).
- You can read more information about our Desktop Apps in the [Desktop Apps Wiki Page](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Gauzy-Desktop-Apps) and about our Server in the [Server Wiki Page](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Gauzy-Server).

## Technology Stack and Requirements

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) language
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) / [NestJs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- [Nx](https://nx.dev)
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs)
- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
- [Ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin)

For Production, we recommend:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)

Note: thanks to TypeORM, Gauzy will support lots of DBs: SQLite (default, for demos), PostgreSQL (development/production), MySql, MariaDb, CockroachDb, MS SQL, Oracle, MongoDb and others, with minimal changes.

#### See also README.md and CREDITS.md files in relevant folders for lists of libraries and software included in the Platform, information about licenses and other details.

## Documentation

Please refer to our official [Platform Documentation](https://docs.gauzy.co) and to our [Wiki](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki) (WIP).

## Quick Start

### With Docker Compose

-   Clone repo.
-   Make sure you have Docker Compose [installed locally](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
-   Copy `.env.compose` file into `.env` file in the root of mono-repo (file contains default env variables definitions). Important: file `.env.compose` is different to `.env.sample` in some settings, please make sure you use correct one!
-   Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up`, if you want to run the platform using our prebuild Docker images. _(Note: it uses latest images pre-build automatically from head of `master` branch using Github CI/CD.)_
-   Run `docker-compose up`, if you want to build everything (code and Docker images) locally. _(Note: this is extremely long process, option above is much faster.)_
-   :coffee: time... It might take some time for our API to seed fake data in the DB during the first Docker Compose run, even if you used prebuild Docker images.
-   Open <http://localhost:4200> in your browser.
-   Login with email `admin@ever.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
-   Login with email `employee@ever.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
-   Enjoy!

Together with Gauzy, Docker Compose will run following:

-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
-   Cross-platform client for PostgreSQL DBs [pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb), on <http://localhost:8081>.
-   [Franchise](https://github.com/HVF/franchise), lightweight but powerful SQL tool with a notebook interface, on <http://localhost:8082>.
-   [OmniDb](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB), on <http://localhost:8083> and using default credentials (admin:admin) configure connection string `postgres://postgres:root@db:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable`.
-   [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) Database management in a single PHP file, on <http://localhost:8084>.

### Manually

-   Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS version, e.g. 14.x (note: at the moment Gauzy may not work with Node 15.x/16.x).
-   Optionally install and run [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) version 11 or 12 (version 13 might not be supported yet). Note: other DB can be configured manually in TypeORM. The default DB is set to SQLite (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
-   Install [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) (if you don't have it) with `npm i -g yarn`.
-   Install NPM packages and bootstrap solution using command `yarn bootstrap`.
-   If you will need to make code changes (and push to Git repo), please run `yarn prepare:husky`.
-   Adjust settings in the [`.env.local`](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/blob/develop/.env.local) which used in local runs.  
-   Alternatively, you can copy [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/blob/develop/.env.sample) to `.env` and change default settings there, e.g. database type, name, user, password, etc.
-   Optionally, if you want to seed a lot of fake data for demo testing, run `yarn seed:all`.
-   Run both API and UI with single command: `yarn start`.
-   Open Gauzy UI on <http://localhost:4200> in your browser (API runs on <http://localhost:3000/api>).
-   Login with email `admin@ever.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
-   Login with email `employee@ever.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
-   Enjoy!

Notes:

-   during the first API start, DB will be automatically seed with minimum set of initial data if no users found.
-   you can run seed any moment manually (e.g. if you changed entities schemas) with `yarn seed` command to re-initialize DB (warning: unsafe for production!).
-   it is possible to run generation of extremely large amount of fake data for demo purposes / testing with `yarn seed:all` (warning: takes ~10 min to complete)

### Production

-   See [Setup Gauzy for Client Server](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Setup-Gauzy-for-Client-Server) for more information about production setup on your servers.
-   For simple deployments scenarios (e.g. for yourself or your own small organization), check our [Kubernetes configurations](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/tree/develop/.deploy/k8s), which we are using to deploy Gauzy demo into [DigitalOcean k8s cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes).
-   In addition, check [Gauzy Pulumi](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy-pulumi) project (WIP), it makes complex Clouds deployments possible with a single command (`pulumi up`). Note: it currently supports AWS EKS (Kubernetes) for development and production with Application Load Balancers and AWS RDS Serverless PostgreSQL DB deployments. We also implemented deployments to ECS EC2 and Fargate Clusters in the same Pulumi project.
