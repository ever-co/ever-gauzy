 * 🛑 This import must stay FIRST, before any import that pulls a core service or controller.

 * `dashboard.entity.ts` applies `@IsEmployeeBelongsToOrganization()` at class-definition time, and
 * that decorator's module reaches the entity graph again through the employee repository. Importing
 * the subject first enters the cycle from the wrong end: the decorator module is still initializing
 * when `dashboard.entity.ts` applies it, so it resolves to `undefined` and the whole suite fails to
 * LOAD with `IsEmployeeBelongsToOrganization is not a function`. Loading the entity barrel first
 * lets that module finish before anything applies it. The API does not hit this because Nest
 * bootstraps the entity graph before the service layer.
