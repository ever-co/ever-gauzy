‚ùå [ERROR] for workspace /github/workspace
Linter raw log:

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.31.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "@nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx".

(The package "@nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/github/workspace".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install @nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx@latest --save-dev

The plugin "@nrwl/eslint-plugin-nx" was referenced from the config file in "--config#overrides[1]".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
